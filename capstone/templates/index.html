Many of these attacks are made possible due to outdated technologies, or because developers aren’t aware of standard security measures. Fortunately, many of these gaps in security can be mitigated through education and software updates.</h2>

                <h3>SQL Injection</h3> 
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows a user to insert additional terms into website database queries. These additional terms may be used to view information without authorization, gain unauthorized access, corrupt/delete data, or deny service to other users. Finding the flaws that allow these additional hostile terms to be used is very easy to detect when reviewing code. This vulnerability is usually enabled when a server does not validate or “sanitize” input provided by the user. Many instances of this vulnerability have been found in code written by inexperienced developers who aren’t aware of the proper security procedures or in legacy code. Lucily, it is easy to prevent this vulnerability.</p>
		<p>Follow along as we demonstrate how a SQL injection attack is performed and how to secure a server so these attacks are no longer permitted.</p>

                <h3>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h3> 
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that attackers can exploit in order to interfere with how a user interacts with a vulnerable website.</p>
		There are three types of XSS attacks:
		<ul>
		    <li>Reflected XSS - attack is mitigated via a HTTP request</li>
		    <li>Stored XSS - attack is mitigated via the website’s backend database</li>
		    <li>DOM-based XSS - attack is mitigated via the client-side Javascript code</li>
		</ul>
