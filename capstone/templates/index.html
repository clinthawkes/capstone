                <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows a user to insert additional terms into website database queries. These additional terms may be used to view information without authorization, gain unauthorized access, corrupt/delete data, or deny service to other users. Finding the flaws that allow these additional hostile terms to be used is very easy to detect when reviewing code. This vulnerability is usually enabled when a server does not validate or “sanitize” input provided by the user. Many instances of this vulnerability have been found in code written by inexperienced developers who aren’t aware of the proper security procedures or in legacy code. Lucily, it is easy to prevent this vulnerability.</p>
                <p>Follow along as we demonstrate how a SQL injection attack is performed and how to secure a server so these attacks are no longer permitted.</p>

                <h3>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that attackers can exploit in order to interfere with how a user interacts with a vulnerable website.</p>
                There are three types of XSS attacks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reflected XSS - attack is mitigated via a HTTP request</li>
                    <li>Stored XSS - attack is mitigated via the website’s backend database</li>
                    <li>DOM-based XSS - attack is mitigated via the client-side Javascript code</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Reflected XSS</h5>
                <p>Reflected XSS occurs when a website receives data in a HTTP request and ‘reflects back’ the data to the user. The website will not process or store this data, thus allowing an attacker to inject malicious content into the website.</p>
                <p>One way an attacker can elicit a reflected XSS attack is to construct a malicious URL and, by way of a phishing email, trick the user into clicking on the malicious URL. This will direct the user to the vulnerable web page injected with the attacker's XSS payload which will execute in the user’s browser. The attacker may try to mimic the login page of the website, and when the user attempts to log in via the fake login page the attacker can steal the user’s login credentials.</p>
                <h5>Stored XSS</h5>
                <p>Stored XSS occurs when an attacker stores a XSS script on a server for later retrieval. The storage of the script can be in the form of forum posts, comments, usernames, or any other form of input that can be viewed at a later time. After the script has been stored, the attacker can carry out an attack by requesting the stored script from the server.</p>
                <h5>Dom-based XSS</h5>
                <p>Dom-based XSS occurs when there is client-side javascript that processes untrusted data from a user and writes it back out to the DOM. When a user is able to control what is displayed in the DOM, there is potential for scripts to be constructed by users that may cause harm. A good rule is to never use client-side javascript to populate the DOM with user supplied data.</p>

                <h3>Security Misconfiguration</h3>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Security misconfiguration is one of the most commonly-seen security flaws in web applications. It refers to any security issue which is not a direct result of a programming error but rather a result of a configuration error. Security misconfiguration is usually a result of using default configurations or passwords, ad hoc or insufficient configurations, open cloud storage, poorly configured HTTP headers or use of detailed error messages containing sensitive information.</p>
		<p>Security misconfigurations can occur at any level of the web application stack; from the web server or back-end database, to the platform or network services. These misconfigurations can be exploited by an attacker in order to gain unauthorized access to the system and in some cases can result in the attacker taking complete control over the system.</p>
		<p>In this project, we will take advantage of security misconfigurations in the web app by exploiting a default account with a default password and inadvertently expose sensitive information via detailed error messages from the server.</p>

                <h3>Broken Authentication</h3>
                <h4>Overview</h4>
		<p>Before we discuss “Broken Authentication” and the attacks related to it, let’s first review the difference between “Authentication” and “Authorization”. Authentication is the process of verifying a user is who they claim to be. This is typically done through the use of a username and password that is set by the user when they create an account. Authorization, on the other hand, is used to determine which users have access to the different resources provided by the website. While authentication and authorization are separate concepts, their uses go hand in hand. Users are given authorization to do certain things, but before the user is able to do those things, the website needs to make sure the user is the person they say they are. If the user is not who they say they are, a secure website should deny the user access to the website. The goal of attacks aimed at authentication vulnerabilities is to deceive the website into thinking the attacker is somebody else in order to gain access to the website. If the attacker is successful, they now have website authorization that was meant for the “real” account owner.</p>
		<p>In this write-up, we will cover a few different attacks that exploit authentication vulnerabilities. We will then explain how to protect yourself from these types of attacks.</p>
