            <p><h3>According to Security Magazine, a study was conducted and found that there is an attack on the web every 39 seconds. Many of these attacks are made possible due to outdated technologies, or because developers arenâ€™t aware of standard security measures. Fortunately, many of these gaps in security can be mitigated through education and software updates.</h2>
